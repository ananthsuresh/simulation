TM_PS input tracking

yp - double ** - 2D Array of doubles used for the solver structure -> Used in tm_ps itself -> exclusively LHS

co - double ** ->passed into ps_step -> into tm_first & tm_iter -> used solely on RHS in those

yold - double * -> array passed into ps_step(called y1 in ps_step) - used both on LHS and RHS

ynew - double * -> array passed into ps_step(still called ynew) - used on LHS and RHS

nrnp - neuron_tm * -> used in tm_ps itself, fields both used and modified, aka LHS and RHS

fp - double * -> array used on both LHS and RHS in tm_ps itself, also passed -> ps_step(still called fp) - used once on RHS and then passed -> tm_first and tm_iter - used on RHS of tm_first, doesn't appear to be used in tm_iter

dt_full - just double - passed by value -> tm_bs(called dt in here) - passed by value -> bs_step- used on RHS and also passed -> mmid(called htot) - used on RHS

order_lim - just int, so always passed by value - used once on RHS in tm_ps, then passed -> ps_step(called ps_limit here) - used on RHS twice
